# Parkinson's Disease Detection: Voice & Image-Based ML & DL Approaches

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline to detect Parkinson's Disease by leveraging two powerful data sources:

1. **Voice Features** – Traditional biomedical data for machine learning models.
2. **Hand-Drawn Spiral Images** – Utilized with CNNs for image-based prediction.

We explore data analysis, apply machine learning models, and build a deep learning image classifier using PyTorch.
